		<section name="The Java Simple Application Framework (jsaf)">
			<p>It's entirely too difficult to create a standalone application with Java. I mean, 
			it's moderately painful to create an app with standard POSIX-compliant command-line options, 
			help available from the command-line, man pages, and support for i18n. This stuff ought to be 
			easy. Somebody else should take care of it so you can just concentrate on writing a great app. 
			Am I right?</p>

            <p>JSAF is still pre-alpha. When completed, it will provide a simplified path for creating 
            professional standalone Java applications. The plan is to make it easy to handle command-line 
            options, with assistance in developing help and documentation (man pages, Maven site docs). 
            I'd also like to simplify creating installation packages for Debian/Ubuntu at first, and 
            perhaps branch out later into other OSs.</p>
            
            <p>The code for this project is still under initial development, and, well, you know how the
            documentation always lags behind even that. For now, take a look in 
            <a href="./jsaf-examples/index.html">jsaf-examples</a> if you are curious.
            Since the documentation is incomplete, it would probably help most to look at the 
            <a href="http://code.google.com/p/java-simple-application-framework/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fjsaf-examples%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fgooglecode%2Fjsaf%2Fexamples">source code</a>.
